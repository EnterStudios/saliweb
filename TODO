Frontend:
  - Fix CSS to properly validate.
  - Add methods to get extra stylesheets, JavaScripts.
  - Add method to frontend class (or options to config file) to configure rate
    limit and period of error reporting, for debugging.
  - If number of incoming jobs exceeds some limit, throw a SystemBusyError.
  - Queue page should highlight authenticated user's own jobs, and have a JS
    button to toggle showing all jobs or just their own.

Backend:
  - Configure DRMAA so that we can submit to both Sali and QB3 clusters from
    the same script.
  - Make sure that DRMAA on the QB3 cluster works with users that have
    different usernames on modbase/chef (e.g. Hao, SJ, Ursula).

Build:
  - Check to make sure MySQL indexes match those set up by the backend.
  - Add more unit tests.
  - After installing each CGI script, try to wget it using cgiroot to make sure
    the webserver is properly configured and there are no Perl compile errors
    (note: tricky since cgiroot may not be accessible).
