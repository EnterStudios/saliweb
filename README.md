This framework provides a simple set of classes and modules to simplify the process of deploying, in the Sali lab, a web service (a web-based front end to jobs that run on the lab cluster). It is designed specifically for the Sali lab environment, but can probably be adapted to run elsewhere if desired.

Documentation on using this framework can be found at
https://salilab.org/saliweb/

For users in the Sali lab, the framework is already set up - nothing further needs to be done. To use outside of the lab, see
the relevant [section in the documentation](https://salilab.org/saliweb/installation.html#outside-of-the-sali-lab).
